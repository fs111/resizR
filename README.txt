resizR
------

resizR is a daemon written in python, which monitors the directory $HOME/resizR
and automatically resizes all images copied into that directory to a configured,
arbitrary list of sizes. It is based on pyinotify [0] and PIL [1].  By default
resizR creates a directory called "resizR" in your $HOME directory.  This is
configurable in the config file, which will be explained later.

The first time you start it (resizR), it will create a directory structure like this:

$ tree resizR/
$HOME/resizR/
|-- 1024x768
|-- 1280x1024
|-- 1600x1200
`-- 800x600

As soon as you copy a new image into the resizR directory it will create a
resized image for all listed formats.

$ cp foo.png ~/resizR
$ tree resizR/
resizR/
|-- 1024x768
|   `-- foo.png
|-- 1280x1024
|   `-- foo.png
|-- 1600x1200
|   `-- foo.png
|-- 800x600
|   `-- foo.png
`-- foo.png

Next to the absolute sizes, resizR also supports relative sizes in percentage.
In order to use that, adapt the config, with the sizes you like.

resizR will also create a directory in your $HOME called .resizR with a file
called resizRconfig.py in it. In that file you can adjust the directory and the
sizes that it will use. By default only absolute sizes are listed, but relative
sizes are also supported.

Next to that you can also enable automatic cleaning of the resizR directory on
startup. This setting is disabled by default. Please note that the config file
is python code itself and resizR will execute anything in the global namespace
of the config file on startup, so be sure what you are doing, if you change the
file beyond the settings that are provided by default.

To prevent your resizR directory from cluttering up, you can force resizR to
clean it up while running, by sending SIGUSR1 to the python process. This will
delete the entire resizR directory and recreate the directories for the
different sizes.

You can run resizR from the checked out git repo or you can run the setup.py
program to install it locally into /usr/bin + its modules in the site-packages
directory of your python installation. The easiest way to use resizR is to put
it in the autostart facilities of your desktop environment or windowmanager,
upon every login is ready to resize any file for you.

I hope you find it useful to some extend and if you change it, please send me
patches!
